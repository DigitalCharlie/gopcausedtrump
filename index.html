                His campaign is built on a strategy of racial resentment, which the Republican party has been using for over 50 years.
            </h2>

            <p>
                In the 1970s, conservatives joined hands with the billionaire class to link public institutions to “undeserving minorities.”  This was an attempt to undo the country’s social contract by weakening the government's ability to protect against market-produced inequities.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the civil rights movement opened up more government programs to people of color that were previously whites-only, the ruling class reacted. They saw that they could gain ground by “dog whistling” about welfare and criminals, using racially coded terms to frighten the white working and middle class about a progressive government coddling people of color. Donald Trump has taken this old dog whistle and turned it into a bullhorn.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is just one portion of the history of the Republican Party that made it possible for Donald Trump to be a legitimate contender for President. Now more than ever, our country must reckon with and repair the wounds of our history. If we want to solve the crises of inequality, structural racism, climate change, and political gridlock, we can no longer avoid uncomfortable truths about the racism of our past and present.

                George Wallace inaugurated as Governor. Declares, “Segregation today, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.”
            </h1>

            <p>
                George Wallace is one of the most famous segregationists of the 1960s. During his campaign he vowed to stand in schoolhouse doors to bar Black students from white schools. Six months after his inauguration, he did just that at the University of Alabama. He was not, however, always a rampant racist — he turned that way after losing the 1958 governor race. He later put it this way: “I started off talking about schools and highways and prisons and taxes, and I couldn’t make them listen. Then I began talking about N***ers, and they stomped the floor.”

            <p>
                Barry Goldwater, the Republican candidate for President, ran on a platform that included his strong opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. President Johnson had signed the legislation into law earlier that year, on the grounds that segregation was a “states’ rights issue.” Goldwater captured the majority of Deep South white voters for the Republican party, marking the beginning of the “Southern Strategy” as a national force. <span class="pinkText">Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, and South Carolina switched to Red for the first time since Reconstruction. He lost handily, but it signaled a major shift in the Republican party.</span>

            The Southern Strategy
        </h1>

        <h3>
            Lee Atwater, advisor and campaign manager to Presidents Reagan and Bush, summed up the Southern Strategy this way: “You start out in 1954 by saying, “N***er, n***er, n***er.” By 1968, you can’t say “n***er” — that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states’ rights and all that stuff. You’re getting so abstract now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these thing you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites.”
        </h3>
        <h3>
            While the name may make it sound like the Southern Strategy was limited to southern states, the reality is that the Southern Strategy has served as the backbone for the Republican party’s national strategy since the 1960s. Its hallmark is playing up racial antagonism — without explicitly talking about race — with the goal of making minorities, rather than concentrated wealth, the enemy of the white middle class.

            <p>
                While Nixon’s primary opponent in 1968 was Hubert Humphrey, Nixon was also flanked on the right by George Wallace. Wallace was polling ahead of both Humphrey and Nixon in the South just a month before the election, and was siphoning votes from Nixon across the country. Nixon’s response was to push two racialized appeals to the front of his campaign: opposing “forced busing” and enforcing “law and order.”

                    <span class="blueText">“Law and order”</span> was one of the rhetorical frames used in resistance to civil rights, painting activists as lawbreakers and criminals — with the goal of shifting the conversation away from white supremacy and toward a neutral-sounding concern for “order.” Similar language is still used regularly today to justify a defense of the status quo that discriminates against people of color.
                </h3>

                <h3>
                    <span class="blueText">“Forced busing”</span> was an incredibly potent euphemism for the system of transporting students across the boundaries of segregated neighborhoods to integrate schools. The problem, of course, was not actually about buses. Mary Frances Berry explains, “African-American attempts to desegregate schools were confronted by white flight and complaints that the problem was not desegregation, but busing, oftentimes by people who sent their children to school everyday on buses, including mediocre white private academies established to avoid integration.”

                Soon-to-be Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell writes the Powell Memo.

            <p>
                The Powell memo was based around a 4 point plan to organize and entrench corporate power. This plan was implemented by and large, and the ramifications over the past 40 years have been disastrous for people of color, poor people, and women. Some of the most widely-known effects were the founding of the ultra-conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, the creation of conservative TV and radio news networks, and the founding of the American Legislative Exchange Council, better known as ALEC.
