            <p>
                In the 1970s, conservatives joined hands with the billionaire class to link public institutions to “undeserving minorities.”  This was an attempt to undo the country’s social contract by weakening the government's ability to protect against market-produced inequities.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the civil rights movement opened up more government programs to people of color that were previously whites-only, the ruling class reacted. They saw that they could gain ground by “dog whistling” about welfare and criminals, using racially coded terms to frighten the white working and middle class about a progressive government coddling people of color. Donald Trump has taken this old dog whistle and turned it into a bullhorn.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is just one portion of the history of the Republican Party that made it possible for Donald Trump to be a legitimate contender for President. Now more than ever, our country must reckon with and repair the wounds of our history. If we want to solve the crises of inequality, structural racism, climate change, and political gridlock, we can no longer avoid uncomfortable truths about the racism of our past and present.
