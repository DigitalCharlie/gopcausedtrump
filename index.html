                His campaign is built on a strategy of racial resentment, which the Republican party has been using for over 50 years.
            </h2>

            <p>
                In the 1970s, conservatives joined hands with the billionaire class to link public institutions to “undeserving minorities.”  This was an attempt to undo the country’s social contract by weakening the government's ability to protect against market-produced inequities.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the civil rights movement opened up more government programs to people of color that were previously whites-only, the ruling class reacted. They saw that they could gain ground by “dog whistling” about welfare and criminals, using racially coded terms to frighten the white working and middle class about a progressive government coddling people of color. Donald Trump has taken this old dog whistle and turned it into a bullhorn.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is just one portion of the history of the Republican Party that made it possible for Donald Trump to be a legitimate contender for President. Now more than ever, our country must reckon with and repair the wounds of our history. If we want to solve the crises of inequality, structural racism, climate change, and political gridlock, we can no longer avoid uncomfortable truths about the racism of our past and present.

                George Wallace inaugurated as Governor. Declares, “Segregation today, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.”
            </h1>

            <p>
                George Wallace is one of the most famous segregationists of the 1960s. During his campaign he vowed to stand in schoolhouse doors to bar Black students from white schools. Six months after his inauguration, he did just that at the University of Alabama. He was not, however, always a rampant racist — he turned that way after losing the 1958 governor race. He later put it this way: “I started off talking about schools and highways and prisons and taxes, and I couldn’t make them listen. Then I began talking about N***ers, and they stomped the floor.”

                Barry Goldwater runs for President.
            </h1>

            <p>
                Barry Goldwater, the Republican candidate for President, ran on a platform that included his strong opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. President Johnson had signed the legislation into law earlier that year, on the grounds that segregation was a “states’ rights issue.” Goldwater captured the majority of Deep South white voters for the Republican party, marking the beginning of the “Southern Strategy” as a national force. <span style="color:#ec476b">Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, and South Carolina switched to Red for the first time since Reconstruction. He lost handily, but it signaled a major shift in the Republican party.</span>

            The Southern Strategy
        </h1>

        <h3>
            Lee Atwater, advisor and campaign manager to Presidents Reagan and Bush, summed up the Southern Strategy this way: “You start out in 1954 by saying, “N***er, n***er, n***er.” By 1968, you can’t say “n***er” — that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states’ rights and all that stuff. You’re getting so abstract now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these thing you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites.”
        </h3>
        <h3>
            While the name may make it sound like the Southern Strategy was limited to southern states, the reality is that the Southern Strategy has served as the backbone for the Republican party’s national strategy since the 1960s. Its hallmark is playing up racial antagonism — without explicitly talking about race — with the goal of making minorities, rather than concentrated wealth, the enemy of the white middle class.
