                    Democrats have also been responsible egregious dog whistle politics, particularly under Bill Clinton in the 1990s. This timeline is also not meant to say that the Republican Party’s racism is the worst of their sins. It is instead meant to be illustrative of the politics and strategies the GOP has used for decades that brought us to a point where an outwardly racist, sexist, xenophobe nearly became president.

                        <p>
                            In the 1970s, conservatives joined hands with the billionaire class to link public institutions to “undeserving minorities.”  This was an attempt to undo the country’s social contract by weakening the government's ability to protect against market-produced inequities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After the civil rights movement opened up more government programs to people of color that were previously whites-only, the ruling class reacted. They saw that they could gain ground by “dog whistling” about welfare and criminals, using racially coded terms to frighten the white working and middle class about a progressive government coddling people of color. Donald Trump has taken this old dog whistle and turned it into a bullhorn.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Below is just one portion of the history of the Republican Party that made it possible for Donald Trump to be a legitimate contender for President. Now more than ever, our country must reckon with and repair the wounds of our history. If we want to solve the crises of inequality, structural racism, climate change, and political gridlock, we can no longer avoid uncomfortable truths about the racism of our past and present.

                            George Wallace is one of the most famous segregationists of the 1960s. During his campaign he vowed to stand in schoolhouse doors to bar Black students from white schools. Six months after his inauguration, he did just that at the University of Alabama. He was not, however, always a rampant racist — he turned that way after losing the 1958 governor race. He later put it this way: “I started off talking about schools and highways and prisons and taxes, and I couldn’t make them listen. Then I began talking about N***ers, and they stomped the floor.”

                            Barry Goldwater, the Republican candidate for President, ran on a platform that included his strong opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. President Johnson had signed the legislation into law earlier that year, on the grounds that segregation was a “states’ rights issue.” Goldwater captured the majority of Deep South white voters for the Republican party, marking the beginning of the “Southern Strategy” as a national force.

                        Lee Atwater, advisor and campaign manager to Presidents Reagan and Bush, summed up the Southern Strategy this way: “You start out in 1954 by saying, “N***er, n***er, n***er.” By 1968, you can’t say “n***er” — that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states’ rights and all that stuff. You’re getting so abstract now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these thing you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites.”

                        While the name may make it sound like the Southern Strategy was limited to southern states, the reality is that the Southern Strategy has served as the backbone for the Republican party’s national strategy since the 1960s. Its hallmark is playing up racial antagonism — without explicitly talking about race — with the goal of making minorities, rather than concentrated wealth, the enemy of the white middle class.

                            While Nixon’s primary opponent in 1968 was Hubert Humphrey, Nixon was also flanked on the right by George Wallace. Wallace was polling ahead of both Humphrey and Nixon in the South just a month before the election, and was siphoning votes from Nixon across the country. Nixon’s response was to push two racialized appeals to the front of his campaign: opposing “forced busing” and enforcing “law and order.”

Some of the most widely-known effects were the founding of the ultra-conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, the creation of conservative TV and radio news networks, and the founding of the American Legislative Exchange Council, better known as ALEC.

                        <p>
                            The Conservative Caucus of State Legislators formed a nonprofit lobbying committee to create standardized state-level legislation to serve the conservative platform. ALEC has produced and pushed for model bills on a broad range of issues at the state level, including: reducing corporate taxation, lowering taxes on the super wealthy, increasing barriers to immigration, weakening and abolishing environmental regulations, tightening voter identification rules, undermining labor unions and opposing background checks. These bills are almost all sponsored by corporations and taken up by conservative politicians. Many bills are copied word-for-word from ALEC's model bills.

                        <p>
                            Among ALEC's founders is Paul Weyrich, who also co-founded the Heritage Foundation and Moral Majority — and later spoke candidly about how the Republican party doesn't want everyone to vote.

                        <p>
                            In 1979, the Supreme Court adopted a “racism as hate” model, requiring proof of explicit malice to prove something is racist. This bar has proven almost insurmountable, barring recorded or in-court uses of racial epithets. Since then, the court has never found discrimination against non-whites — even though just 15 years had passed since the Civil Rights Act was passed.

                    <h3>
                        One of the first moves to prevent integration was pushing the idea that everyone should be color-blind. Among the first politicians to push for such an approach was Barry Goldwater. In the 1960s, shortly after Brown vs. Board of Ed, he argued that because the Constitution is color-blind, integration is just as bad as segregation. 
                    </h3>
                    <h3>
                        It took years for such an approach to take hold. When a color-blind approach first reached the Supreme Court, it was summarily rejected because it was seen as an obvious attempt to avoid integration. President Nixon, however, appointed four new justices to the Supreme Court during his tenure, paving the way for a color-blind approach to become law. This ultimately set the precedent that racism is exclusively individual, rather than structural. The result was a systematic dismantling of all government programs that sought to address any of the harms of slavery or Jim Crow — just 15 years after the Civil Rights Act.
                    </h3>
                    <h3>
                        A major part of the pretense of color-blindness was shifting toward discussing ethnicity rather than race. People could pretend their racism was merely about cultural difference — something “acceptable” to talk about.

                            In 1988, President Bush was behind in the polls — until he listened to the advice of Lee Atwater and began running an advertisement based on a black man named Willie Horton, who was serving a life sentence for murder. The ad nnarrated the case with his mug shot on screen and flashing words like, “kidnapping,” “stabbing,” and “raping” on the screen — before concluding with, “Weekend prison passes: Dukakis on crime.” The ad didn't talk directly about race; instead it used Horton’s image and the apprehension around law and order that had been built since the Nixon campaign. The ad allowed the Bush campaign could benefit from stoking racialized fears and antagonism without directly talking about race.

                        <p>
                            In 1996, media magnate Rupert Murdoch launched Fox News, a conservative news network designed to put forward the news with as conservative a slant as possible. At the helm was Roger Ailes, the man responsible for Richard Nixon’s media strategy. Unsurprisingly, Fox has since engaged in incessant racially charged attacks, recycling the coded language that stoked the same racial resentments that the Republican party had mobilized since the Southern Strategy. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It's worth noting that Fox News is not the first conservative television news network. Within a couple of years of the Powell memo, Joseph Coors (the ultra-conservative head of Coors beer) created a television network called Television News Incorporated. And just like with Fox News, Roger Ailes was on board, serving as the network’s news director.
